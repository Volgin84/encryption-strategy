# Strategy Pattern Encryption Example

## Overview

This project is a simple console application demonstrating the use of the Strategy Design Pattern to implement different encryption algorithms. This app allows the user to encrypt input text using one of three encryption algorithms:

1. Caesar Cipher
2. RSA
3. AES

## How to Run

Easiest way to run is straight throught the VS IDE.
Alternatively should you wish to compile and run code with the windows terminal
ensure that .NET SDK is installed on your system. 

## Usage

The application will loop until you exit. To choose an encryption strategy, type the corresponding number when prompted. To exit the application, type 'exit'.

## Implementation Details

Instead of using abstract classes, this project uses an interface implemented by each strategy class.
