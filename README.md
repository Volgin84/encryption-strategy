// This project is a simple demonstration of a usefull application
// of "strategy" desing pattern. Instead of abstract classes 
// I have chosen to use an inteface that is implemented by each 
// strategy class in the app.

// When ran this console app will allow you to encrypt input text using 3 different
// encryptions. 

// 1 - Cesear Cipher
// 2 - RSA 
// 3 - AES

// App will work in a loop until you break it by typing 'exit' when  
// prompted to select your encryption.
