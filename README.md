# Strategy Pattern Encryption Example

## Overview

This project is a simple console application demonstrating the use of the Strategy Design Pattern to implement different encryption algorithms. This app allows the user to encrypt input text using one of three encryption algorithms:

1. Caesar Cipher
2. RSA
3. AES

## How to Run

Explain how to compile and run the application.

## Usage

The application will loop until you exit. To choose an encryption strategy, type the corresponding number when prompted. To exit the application, type 'exit'.

## Implementation Details

Instead of using abstract classes, this project uses an interface implemented by each strategy class.
